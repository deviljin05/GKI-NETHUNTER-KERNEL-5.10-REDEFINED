**⚡ Blazing fast GKI kernel for Android** with KernelSU, SuSFS, NetHunter, NTSync, performance optimizations, battery improvements, and advanced security features.

---

> [!Note]
> ### 🔧 This is a trimmed single-target fork
> This copy only builds **one** configuration — everything else was stripped out:
> - **GKI line:** 5.10 only (Android 12 LTS) — the 5.15/6.1/6.6/6.12 branches, config maps and changelog logic were removed
> - **Root:** KernelSU only — Vanilla and ReSukiSU variants removed
> - **Always on:** SuSFS, DroidSpaces, NetHunter (incl. Realtek `rtl8xxxu` + `rtw88` drivers), BBRv3, Baseband Guard, NoMount, NTSync, KernelSU multi-manager patch
> - **Removed:** the `Compat+` variant/LTO fallback, the `kernel-patches/common` set (6.1+ only, never applied to 5.10 anyway), and the unused SuSFS mount/task_mmu fixups that only applied to the 6.1/6.12 lines
> - **Toolchain:** unchanged — still Neutron Clang via antman
>
> ⚠️ The NetHunter monitor-mode/packet-injection patch and the upstream `rtw88` driver swap were originally gated to only run on kernel > 5.15 in this repo (i.e. never on 5.10). That gate has been removed so they now run on 5.10 too, but they were written against newer kernel trees — `apply_patch_file` will warn and skip cleanly if a hunk doesn't apply rather than fail the build, but it's worth checking the build log / `rejected-patches-*` artifact after a real run to confirm they actually applied.

---

> [!Important]
> - This is a **GKI** kernel, not a custom kernel. It works on **ANY** device that ships with a matching GKI Linux version.
> - Supported GKI versions: **5.10, 5.15, 6.1, 6.6, 6.12** (see [Supported GKI Kernel Versions](#-supported-gki-kernel-versions) below).

## ❤️ Support This Project

**[Donations](https://github.com/ahmed-alnassif#-support-my-work)**

Your donations keep this project alive! I spend countless hours maintaining kernel builds for 5 different versions, fixing bugs, adding features, and supporting users. **Every donation matters!** 🙏

---

## ✨ ReSuSFS 

**[ReSuSFS](https://github.com/ahmed-alnassif/ReSuSFS)** – Root hiding made simple, powerful when you need it. A [KernelSU](https://kernelsu.org) module and WebUI that turns SuSFS into clean config files and toggle switches for everyday use, with **strong hiding applied out of the box** via built-in spoofing and hiding scripts for one-tap protection, plus a script manager for power users who want more, all without leaving the WebUI.

---
